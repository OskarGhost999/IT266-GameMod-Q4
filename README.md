THIS IS A MOD THAT DOES NOT REALLY WORK
In this MOD I designed a small map to play the game mode that once was famous in COD black ups 3, UPLINK. 
In the game, we have two teams BLUE and RED, both teams fight each other on a deathmatch and at the same time 
trying to get to the other side of the map to score a GOAL.
To be able to play this game:

1. Buy the Quake 4 from Steam.

2. Download the files from my GitHub https://github.com/OskarGhost999/IT266-GameMod-Q4

3. Unzip the folder

4. Navigate in the folder GameMod-Q4, in that folder, you will find a folder called Omicron

5. Copy the Omicron folder by doing “ctrl c” or by using the right mouse click

6. Navigate to where you saved the game from Steam, something similar to this D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Quake 4

7. In the Quake 4 folder paste the Omicron folder by doing “ctrl v” or by using the right mouse click.

8. In that same folder (Quake 4) you will also find a file Quake4.exe, that file is used to execute the game.

9. Double click on the file Quake4.exe and it will launch the game.

10. Once you are in the game, at the bottom left you will see an option that is called “MODS”, do left-click there.

11. Now there are two options to select from, SELECT the option Omicron. Don't worry about the other option.

12. Now, you will look like a hacker because you will need to open the built-in console, you can open the console by doing “alt+ctrl+~”.

13. Once the console is open you need to type “map game/testing”, yeah yeah yeah I know that's the only name I could come up with when creating the map.

14. Now press ENTER and have fun.
